# How To Import The Bookmarks

# How can I get notified for new features?
### (6a) Version checker can check what version your on and what version github is on. 

# Trouble Shooting
### Some bookmarks are removed on some platforms. If you are on ChromeOS every option will be here but on Windows/Mac/Linux some options will be removed like the certificate manager. Most of the bookmarks have to be executed in a website and not a new tab because Javascript cannot run inside of the new tab page.

# Fun facts
