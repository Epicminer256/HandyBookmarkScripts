# HandyBookmarkScripts
### This is a collection of javascript bookmarks I made. There are 20+ useful tools such as Proxys, Tab Hiders, Inspect Element, Chrome Secret Settings (desktop users have less settings), Soft/Hard Restart (made for chrome os), Soundboard (popout version will be made soon), and more.

# How To Import The Bookmarks
### 1) Download the tools.html file (you may need to unzip before importing). 
### 2) Then right click your bookmark bar and click bookmark manager (or chrome://bookmarks). 
### 3) In that new tab look at the top right and click the three dots. 
### 4) On that popup window click "Import Bookmarks". 
### 5) Now select that file you downloaded and they are added as a new folder called "Imported".
### 6) In that folder there is another called "tools", which you can drag and drop to the start of your bookmark bar. 
###
### Now everything is set and ready to work!

# Other things you need to know
### Alloy needs chrome security turned off because chrome doesnt like it. It detects it as a "Phishing website". Alloy may be replaced with a better version that chrome may not freak out about.
### When executing most of these bookmarks you have to be on a tab with a webpage becuase they are coded in javascript. This means you cannot use them on your new tab page rather a tab with a webpage on it.
### Every tool entry has a number like (3a) so they don't have to be identified by folder and bookmark name.
### Also I update these tools allot, so in order to check your tools version with the latest version use the tool "(6a) Version Checker"
### Some of the proxys need to be refreshed before launching a second time
